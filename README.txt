This version is in beta!

I've tried to make a simple addon that easily tracks loot in M+ dungeons.
Why? Because I'm too lazy to look though chat, find correct person and manually filter their loot for the item I want to inspect.
This addon only shows gear and weapons in the loot frame.

Known bugs/issues:
- LUA-error when using /mythicplusloot after leaving M+ group or if one/more group members left. (Don't know why you would need to do that, but it do create LUA-error).
- Players not looting anything relevant sometimes shows up in loot frame anyway (looting sparks etc.).
- Whisper button can be inconsistent.
- To compare items you need to hold down the SHIFT-key before hovering your mouse over the item.
